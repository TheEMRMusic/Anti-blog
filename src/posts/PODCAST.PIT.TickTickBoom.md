## About *Putting It Together*

This is a podcast about Stephen Sondheim's entire body of work show by show and song by song. Each week Kyle Marshall invites an expert to discuss a Sondheim song in-depth. Together they discover the humour, how the songs inform character, and any hidden meanings. Most importantly they try to understand the man behind the music, the Shakespeare of our time, as best they can.

You can start from the beginning, or you can jump to your favourite song. Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome at puttingittogetherpodcast@gmail.com
