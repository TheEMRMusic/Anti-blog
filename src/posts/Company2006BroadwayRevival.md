## About *This One Goes to 11*

Are you searching for some amazing music, but you can't bear to sift through all those elitist-sounding music reviews out there? Join theatre artists and music enthusiasts Michael and Tyler on their quest to find the perfect album. Each week they invite a guest (or two) to share stories about the music that made them who they are AND to suggest what THEY believe is the perfect album. An album so brilliant that "10 out of 10" just doesn't do it justice.
