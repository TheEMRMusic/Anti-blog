## Everything's Coming Up Roses – Gypsy (with Eric Matthew Richardson)

**[LINK TO EPISODE](https://puttingittogether.transistor.fm/s2/9)**

>Eric Matthew Richardson is a composer who lives in Chicago. He may or may not have some radical things to say about "Everything's Coming Up Roses," the song that closes Act 1 of *Gypsy*. Certainly he is knowledgable about the song and the history of the show. Plus, we hear some audio snippets from Arthur Laurents as he discusses not only Gypsy, but what makes a good musical director.
