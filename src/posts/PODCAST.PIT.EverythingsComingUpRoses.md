## Everything's Coming Up Roses – Gypsy (with Eric Matthew Richardson)


- **[LINK TO EPISODE](https://puttingittogether.transistor.fm/s2/9)**

>Eric Matthew Richardson is a composer who lives in Chicago. He may or may not have some radical things to say about "Everything's Coming Up Roses," the song that closes Act 1 of *Gypsy*. Certainly he is knowledgable about the song and the history of the show. Plus, we hear some audio snippets from Arthur Laurents as he discusses not only Gypsy, but what makes a good musical director.

## About *Putting It Together*

This is a podcast about Stephen Sondheim's entire body of work show by show and song by song. Each week Kyle Marshall invites an expert to discuss a Sondheim song in-depth. Together they discover the humour, how the songs inform character, and any hidden meanings. Most importantly they try to understand the man behind the music, the Shakespeare of our time, as best they can.
