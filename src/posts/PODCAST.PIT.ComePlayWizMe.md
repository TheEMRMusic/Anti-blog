## Come Play Wiz Me – Anyone Can Whistle (with Eric Matthew Richardson)


- **[LINK TO EPISODE](https://puttingittogether.transistor.fm/s4/6)**

>Kyle's ability to do a French accent isn't very good. But this song, Come Play Wiz Me, is a fascinating example of pastiche. It's a musical style in which Stephen Sondheim is well known for. Eric Matthew Richardson returns to offer his expertise on that, plus gives a bunch of references ranging from Shakespeare to Monty Python.

## About *Putting It Together*

This is a podcast about Stephen Sondheim's entire body of work show by show and song by song. Each week Kyle Marshall invites an expert to discuss a Sondheim song in-depth. Together they discover the humour, how the songs inform character, and any hidden meanings. Most importantly they try to understand the man behind the music, the Shakespeare of our time, as best they can.
